## Exercise description:

A Brazilian car rental company charges an hourly rate for rentals of up to 12 hours. However, if the duration of the rental exceeds 12 hours, the rental will be charged based on a daily rate. In addition to the rental value, the tax value is added to the price according to the country's rules which, in the case of Brazil, is 20% for values ​​up to 100.00, or 15% for values ​​above 100.00. Write a program that reads the rental data (car model, initial and final instant rental), as well as the hourly value and daily rental value. The program must then generate a payment note (containing the contract amount, tax amount and total payment amount) and enter the data on the screen.
